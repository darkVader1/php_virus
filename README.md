### php_virus
A virus I wrote in PHP

# Overview:

I won't deny, this virus has been heavily inspired by the talk: 
Writing Viruses for fun and not for profit.

The speaker gives a detailed explanation about what viruses are and how they spread and affect computers.
I have built upon that work and will keep pushing updates, as and when I get the time. 

Basically, this virus infects all your php files and will copy itself onto them and the process repeats.

# For the future:
I have not added any payload yet. I am working on getting the infection mechanism right first. I hope to add payloads(I was thinking of using JSON) to this in the future.
You can modify this virus to infect any file. And it can become pretty nasty.

### to do:
The virus infects itself and reinfects already infected files. This will be fixed by me in the future. 

Feel free to contribute to it and build on it if you please.

# Warning:

Please do not use this virus to cause any harm. I am not responsible for any misuse of the code.

## Please note:
Do not run this on your personal server/localhost, please run it in a virtual environment! It infects all files in your system
Cleaning it up is a mess. Run it at your own risk.
